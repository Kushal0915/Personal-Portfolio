                <h3>PackScheduler</h3>
                <p>This is a scheduling program which both students and faculty can use.
                In terms of students they simply add courses to take for their next semester.
                On the other hand, faculty use it to assign courses to teach.
                It has multiple functionalities from loading in data about users and courses
                In addition, it can also export the current schedules of people if
                if the current user is the registrar (person who manages students, faculty, and
                courses in the schedule).</p>

                <h3>SortingVisualizer</h3>
                <p>This is a sorting visualizer program that contains 5 sorting algorithms 
                    from Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
                    Users also have the option of setting their array size with a minimum of 10 elements
                    and a maximum of 50 elements. During the sorting the program will highlight which array is
                    being compared with the others and show its movement.

                <h3>2048 Duplicate</h3>
                <p>2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle video game written by Italian 
                    web developer Gabriele Cirulli and published on GitHub. The objective of the 
                    game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with 
                    the number 2048; however, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, 
                    creating tiles with larger numbers. This project is essentially a duplicate of this 
                    game utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build it.
